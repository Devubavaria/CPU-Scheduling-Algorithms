# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm shortly known as FCFS is the first algorithm of CPU Process Scheduling Algorithm. In First Come First Serve Algorithm what we do is to allow the process to execute in linear manner.This means that whichever process enters process enters the ready queue first is executed first. This shows that First Come First Serve Algorithm follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The First Come First Serve Algorithm can be executed in Pre Emptive and Non Pre Emptive manner. 

This algorithm is the preemptive version of the shortest job first (SJF) scheduling or the shortest job next (SJN). In this SRTF scheduling, the process with the least burst time remaining is executed first. So, in this scheduling, the processes are scheduled based on their remaining execution time.
